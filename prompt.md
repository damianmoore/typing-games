i want you build a next.js, tailwind and daisy ui project. it is for a typing game. for now there will be a single screen that shows a random word at the top and then the child has to type the same latters to make the word. there should be underscore-style blanks for the letters that need to typed. the letter that the game is waiting for should pulse slowly. if a correct letter is entered then the it fills the blank and the next underscore line starts pusing. if the wrong letter is entered then shoul still enter and move on but show red - the user is expected to use backspace. when a word is completed correcly there should be a confetti explosion for a few minutes using react-confetti library and then the next random word should be shown and the process repeats. all words should be displayed in all caps and entered letters should be written in caps too, regardless of capslock/shift. there should be a dark/light mode selector in the top right corner of the screen switching daisy ui theme. words will be very large - the image is representitive of the whole window. scale the font to the size of the window.
